TITLE: Implementing Browser-Safe Component Logic with afterNextRender in Angular
DESCRIPTION: Demonstrates how to safely access browser-specific properties using the afterNextRender lifecycle hook. The component uses ViewChild to reference a DOM element and accesses its scrollHeight property only after rendering in the browser environment.
SOURCE: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/adev/src/content/guide/ssr.md#2025-04-22_snippet_13

LANGUAGE: typescript
CODE:
```

@Component({
  selector: 'my-cmp',
  template: `<span #content>{{ ... }}</span>`,
})
export class MyComponent {
  @ViewChild('content') contentRef: ElementRef;

  constructor() {
    afterNextRender(() => {
      // Safe to check `scrollHeight` because this will only run in the browser, not the server.
      console.log('content height: ' + this.contentRef.nativeElement.scrollHeight);
    });

}
```

----------------------------------------

TITLE: Displaying Housing Location Details in Angular Template (TypeScript)
DESCRIPTION: Updates the template for the `DetailsComponent` (`src/app/details/details.component.ts`) to display detailed information about a housing location. It binds to properties of the `housingLocation` object (e.g., `photo`, `name`, `city`). The optional chaining operator (`?`) is used (e.g., `housingLocation?.name`) to safely access these properties, preventing errors if `housingLocation` is initially null or undefined while data is being fetched.

TITLE: Using RouterLink with Dynamic Parameters (Array Syntax) in Angular
DESCRIPTION: Demonstrates how to use the array syntax (`[routerLink]`) with the `RouterLink` directive to dynamically construct a navigation path. This example builds a link to a user-specific route by including the value of the `currentUserId` component property in the path.
SOURCE: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/adev/src/content/guide/routing/navigate-to-routes.md#2025-04-22_snippet_3

LANGUAGE: angular-html
CODE:
```
<a [routerLink]="['user', currentUserId]">Current User</a>
```

----------------------------------------

TITLE: Displaying Conditional Content Using @if Block in Angular Templates (Angular-HTML)
DESCRIPTION: This snippet demonstrates the use of the built-in @if and @else blocks for conditional rendering within Angular templates. Content is only added to the DOM if the condition expression evaluates to true, with support for multiple branches (@else if and @else). Variables 'a' and 'b' are compared, and the output changes accordingly. No external dependencies beyond Angular are required; this syntax is intended for use within Angular HTML templates.
SOURCE: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/tools/manual_api_docs/blocks/if.md#2025-04-22_snippet_0

LANGUAGE: angular-html

TITLE: Fetching Data Based on Route Parameter in Angular Component (TypeScript)
DESCRIPTION: Updates the `DetailsComponent` class (`src/app/details/details.component.ts`) to fetch and handle housing location data. It injects `HousingService` alongside `ActivatedRoute`. The constructor now retrieves the `id` from the route parameter, converts it to a number, and then calls `housingService.getHousingLocationById()` with this ID. The result (the specific `HousingLocation` data) is assigned to the `housingLocation` property, making it available to the template. The `HousingLocation` interface defines the expected structure.

----------------------------------------

TITLE: Implementing Equality Checks with Computed Signals and Effects in TypeScript
DESCRIPTION: Sets up an Angular `signal` named `counter`, a `computed` signal `isEven` derived from `counter`, and an `effect` that logs the parity of `isEven`. This example highlights equality semantics: the effect should only re-run when the boolean value of `isEven` actually changes (from true to false or vice-versa), even if underlying `counter` updates might result in the same computed `isEven` value (e.g., changing `counter` from 1 to 3, where `isEven` remains false). This necessitates value versioning.
SOURCE: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/packages/core/primitives/signals/README.md#2025-04-22_snippet_7

LANGUAGE: typescript
CODE:
```
```typescript

TITLE: Creating Custom Providers Using InjectionToken in Angular (TypeScript)
DESCRIPTION: This snippet shows how to create a custom InjectionToken to inject browser APIs, such as localStorage, into Angular services. It defines an InjectionToken named BROWSER_STORAGE, which is provided in the root injector with a factory returning localStorage, allowing BrowserStorageService to consume this dependency.

DESCRIPTION: This snippet demonstrates how to define classes and configure Angular's DI injector to manage dependencies between them. It creates bindings for `Car` and `Engine`, injects dependencies using the `@Inject` annotation, and shows how to resolve and instantiate registered types. Dependencies: Angular DI module, class definitions for Car and Engine. Inputs are class constructors, outputs are injected instances with their dependencies resolved; errors may occur if bindings are missing.

The providers array uses provide and useExisting to register a dependency on PARENT_MENU_ITEM, referencing the MenuItem class with forwardRef to defer its evaluation until the class is defined. This approach is essential when the target class is not yet declared due to the file's declaration order, preventing reference errors in complex provider configurations.

TITLE: Reading from Node Injector with Feature Callback for Tree-Shaking (TypeScript)
DESCRIPTION: Defines a function 'readFromNodeInjector' that now accepts a feature function 'readFn' instead of an enum, enabling the function to delegate reading logic via the passed-in callback.

TITLE: Using afterNextRender Phases for DOM Manipulation in Angular (TypeScript)
DESCRIPTION: This TypeScript snippet demonstrates using the `afterNextRender` hook within an Angular component's constructor. It utilizes the `write` phase to potentially update an element's padding style based on `computePadding()` and returns a boolean indicating if a change occurred. The subsequent `read` phase uses this boolean to conditionally read the element's height using `getBoundingClientRect()` only after potential DOM writes have completed, thus minimizing layout thrashing. It injects `ElementRef` to access the native DOM element.
SOURCE: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/adev/src/content/guide/components/lifecycle.md#2025-04-22_snippet_2

LANGUAGE: typescript
CODE:
```
```ts
import {Component, ElementRef, afterNextRender} from '@angular/core';

@Component({...})
export class UserProfile {
  private prevPadding = 0;
  private elementHeight = 0;

  constructor() {
    private elementRef = inject(ElementRef);
    const nativeElement = elementRef.nativeElement;

    afterNextRender({
      // Use the `Write` phase to write to a geometric property.
      write: () => {
        const padding = computePadding();
        const changed = padding !== this.prevPadding;
        if (changed) {
          nativeElement.style.padding = padding;
        }
        return changed; // Communicate whether anything changed to the read phase.
      },

      // Use the `Read` phase to read geometric properties after all writes have occurred.
      read: (didWrite) => {
        if (didWrite) {

TITLE: Lazily Instantiating and Caching Dependencies using Angular Injector - JavaScript
DESCRIPTION: These snippets illustrate how the Angular injector creates and caches object instances on-demand, demonstrating the effect of different retrieval orders on instance creation and cache reuse. No external dependencies beyond the injector, but constructors must be side-effect-free for correct caching behavior. Inputs are requested types, outputs are instances either created or retrieved from cache; improper binding or side-effects can lead to bugs.

TITLE: Conditional Import of In-Memory Web API in Production (TypeScript)
DESCRIPTION: Shows how to conditionally add the HttpClientInMemoryWebApiModule using an Angular environment flag to prevent in-memory API interception in production. This requires an environment configuration object (e.g., environment.production) and is typically integrated in the main application module's imports array. All dependencies remain the same as standard usage, but in production, only the real HTTP backend is used.
SOURCE: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/packages/misc/angular-in-memory-web-api/README.md#2025-04-22_snippet_2

TITLE: Handling Projectable Nodes with createComponent in Angular
DESCRIPTION: This TypeScript snippet demonstrates how to provide projectable nodes when creating a component programmatically using Angular's `createComponent` API in version 19. It shows the updated behavior where passing an empty array now renders the default `ng-content` fallback, and how to explicitly prevent this by passing an empty text node instead.
SOURCE: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#_snippet_0

LANGUAGE: TypeScript
CODE:
```
// The first ng-content will render the default fallback content if present
createComponent(MyComponent. { projectableNodes: [[], [secondNode]] });

// To prevent projecting the default fallback content:
createComponent(MyComponent. { projectableNodes: [[document.createTextNode('')], [secondNode]] });
```

----------------------------------------

TITLE: Configure TestBed with Zoneless Change Detection (TypeScript)
DESCRIPTION: Explains how to set up Angular's `TestBed` to simulate a zoneless environment by adding `provideZonelessChangeDetection()` to its providers. This allows testing component compatibility and encourages the use of `fixture.whenStable()` instead of `fixture.detectChanges()` for more realistic testing.
SOURCE: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/adev/src/content/guide/zoneless.md#_snippet_5

TITLE: Using @defer with 'hydrate on immediate' Trigger (Angular HTML)
DESCRIPTION: This Angular HTML template snippet illustrates the `@defer` block with the `hydrate on immediate` trigger. The content (`<large-cmp />`) is hydrated immediately after all non-deferred content on the page has finished rendering and hydrating. This ensures the deferred content hydrates as soon as possible without blocking the initial render.

```

----------------------------------------

TITLE: Configuring Language Redirection with Apache
DESCRIPTION: This Apache configuration snippet demonstrates setting up redirection for a multi-locale Angular application using `mod_rewrite`. It enables the rewrite engine and defines rules to detect the user's preferred language ('en' or 'fr') from the `Accept-Language` header. If a preferred language is detected and a corresponding directory exists, the user is redirected to that language-specific subdirectory (e.g., `/fr/`). If no preference matches or the directory doesn't exist, it defaults to redirecting to the '/en/' subdirectory.

TITLE: Using fill Attribute for Background Image Behavior in Angular Template
DESCRIPTION: When you cannot specify fixed `width` and `height` for an image, use the `fill` attribute on the `<img>` tag with `ngSrc`. This makes the image behave like a background image, stretching to fill its containing element. The parent container *must* have CSS `position` set to `relative`, `fixed`, or `absolute` for `fill` to work correctly.

TITLE: Resetting Database and Fetching Data Sequence - Angular In-Memory Web API - TypeScript
DESCRIPTION: This TypeScript snippet shows a chained sequence of HTTP requests using the Angular HTTP client. It resets the in-memory database collections with a 'clear' option, waits for completion, and then retrieves the 'heroes' collection. The implementation uses .concatMap and .map operators to process the observable stream and handles the final data in a subscription. Dependencies include RxJS for observable chaining and the Angular HTTP client for requests. Key parameters: the 'clear' option passed in the reset request, and the data type for heroes. The input expects command endpoints and returns observable streams.
SOURCE: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/packages/misc/angular-in-memory-web-api/README.md#2025-04-22_snippet_5

LANGUAGE: typescript
CODE:

TITLE: Defining and Using API via Lightweight Injection Token in Angular (TypeScript)
DESCRIPTION: This TypeScript example extends the lightweight injection token pattern by adding an abstract `doSomething` method to `LibHeaderToken`. `LibHeaderComponent` provides the concrete implementation. `LibCardComponent` queries for `LibHeaderToken` and safely calls the `doSomething` method on the header if it exists (`this.header?.doSomething()`), allowing interaction without preventing tree-shaking.
SOURCE: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/adev/src/content/guide/di/lightweight-injection-tokens.md#2025-04-22_snippet_5

LANGUAGE: typescript
CODE:
```
abstract class LibHeaderToken {
  abstract doSomething(): void;
}

@Component({
  selector: 'lib-header',
  providers: [
    {provide: LibHeaderToken, useExisting: LibHeaderComponent}
  ]
  …,
})
class LibHeaderComponent extends LibHeaderToken {
  doSomething(): void {
    // Concrete implementation of `doSomething`
  }
}

@Component({
  selector: 'lib-card',
  …,
})
class LibCardComponent implement AfterContentInit {
  @ContentChild(LibHeaderToken) header: LibHeaderToken|null = null;

  ngAfterContentInit(): void {
    if (this.header !== null) {
      this.header?.doSomething();
    }
  }
}

TITLE: Implementing Core Logic for a Custom Structural Directive (TypeScript)
DESCRIPTION: Implements the `ngOnInit` lifecycle hook in `SelectDirective`. Inside `ngOnInit`, it asynchronously loads data using the `selectFrom` input's `load()` method. Once data is retrieved, it uses `viewContainerRef.createEmbeddedView` to instantiate the associated template (`templateRef`). It passes the loaded data to the template's context using the special `$implicit` key, making the data accessible via a `let data` declaration in the template.
SOURCE: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/adev/src/content/guide/directives/structural-directives.md#2025-04-22_snippet_6

LANGUAGE: ts
CODE:
```
export class SelectDirective {
  // ...

  async ngOnInit() {
    const data = await this.selectFrom.load();
    this.viewContainerRef.createEmbeddedView(this.templateRef, {
      // Create the embedded view with a context object that contains
      // the data via the key `$implicit`.
      $implicit: data,
    });
  }
}
```

----------------------------------------

TITLE: Aliasing Services with useExisting in Angular (TypeScript)
DESCRIPTION: Demonstrates how to make one DI token ('OldLogger') serve as an alias for another ('NewLogger') using 'useExisting', ensuring both tokens resolve to the same instance. It's crucial for singleton services and provides consistency across a codebase when refactoring or maintaining backward compatibility. Both 'NewLogger' and 'OldLogger' should be injectable.
SOURCE: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/adev/src/content/guide/di/dependency-injection-providers.md#2025-04-22_snippet_5

LANGUAGE: typescript

TITLE: Using Relative Path with Configured Image Loader in Angular Template
DESCRIPTION: After configuring an image loader in your providers (e.g., using `provideImgixLoader`), you can use relative paths with the `ngSrc` attribute in your template. The configured loader will prepend the base URL to the relative path (`image.png` in this case) to generate the final image URL (`https://my.base.url/image.png`).

TITLE: Displaying Validation Errors in Angular Template-Driven Forms (HTML)
DESCRIPTION: Shows how to display validation error messages in an Angular template-driven form. It uses the `ngModel` export (`#name="ngModel"`) to check the control's `valid`, `dirty`, and `touched` states. Standard HTML attributes (`required`, `minlength`) and a custom validator directive (`forbiddenName`) are applied. Error messages for `required`, `minlength`, and `forbiddenName` are conditionally displayed using `*ngIf` based on the control's validity and interaction state (dirty or touched).

TITLE: Querying Optional Child Component Directly with @ContentChild (TypeScript)
DESCRIPTION: This TypeScript code defines `LibHeaderComponent` and `LibCardComponent`. `LibCardComponent` uses `@ContentChild(LibHeaderComponent)` to potentially access an instance of `LibHeaderComponent`. This direct reference to the concrete type in the `@ContentChild` decorator (a value position) prevents `LibHeaderComponent` from being tree-shaken even if it's not used in the template.

TITLE: Defining App NgModule and Bootstrapping Setup - Angular - TypeScript
DESCRIPTION: This snippet configures a classic Angular module by importing necessary dependencies, declaring the AppComponent, specifying modules to import, and defining the providers array for dependency injection. It also demonstrates how to bootstrap the Angular app using the AppModule. Parameters like providers and imports determine application-wide dependencies and routing setup. Any dependencies like SharedModule, BrowserAnimationsModule, RouterModule, and AppComponent must be defined or imported properly. Outputs are registered module classes; intended for environments still using `bootstrapModule`. Limitations: tightly coupled to NgModule lifecycle.

The snippet shows that referencing the ambient type directly causes a static analysis error by the Angular compiler, as it cannot resolve the provider for the type. No special dependencies are needed, but it illustrates what not to do when using ambient types in dependency injection.

TITLE: Importing and Injecting DOCUMENT from @angular/common in Angular (TypeScript)
DESCRIPTION: This snippet shows the pre-migration approach where the DOCUMENT token is imported from @angular/common for dependency injection in an Angular component. The import statement separately brings in Component and inject from @angular/core, and DOCUMENT from @angular/common. The MyComp component injects the DOCUMENT in its constructor. Requires Angular libraries @angular/core and @angular/common. Inputs include no explicit constructor params; the output is an instance property containing the injected DOCUMENT. Post-migration to Angular v16+, this pattern is deprecated.

TITLE: RequestInfo Interface Structure for Custom HTTP Methods - TypeScript
DESCRIPTION: This TypeScript snippet outlines the shape of the RequestInfo interface that is provided when overriding HTTP methods in the In-Memory Web API. The snippet includes types and documentation for each property, such as the request object, collection information, request URL, resource id, and helper utilities. Implementers rely on this structure to analyze requests and formulate custom responses. Dependencies: RequestInfo and RequestInfoUtilities interfaces from the package. Inputs include the HTTP request and supporting data; outputs involve custom observable responses or delegation to default handling.
SOURCE: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/packages/misc/angular-in-memory-web-api/README.md#2025-04-22_snippet_8

LANGUAGE: typescript
CODE:
```
req: Request;           // the request object from the client
collectionName: string; // calculated from the request url
collection: any[];      // the corresponding collection (if found)
id: any;                // the item `id` (if specified)
url: string;            // the url in the request
utils: RequestInfoUtilities; // helper functions

TITLE: Transformed Default Import Usage with CommonJS - JavaScript
DESCRIPTION: Demonstrates the CommonJS-style output of a default import after TypeScript compilation, especially in the context of value usage such as Angular dependency injection. The transformation creates a require() call and accesses the default property at runtime. Dependencies: Node.js/CommonJS, TypeScript. Inputs: module path; Outputs: inject call referencing default property. Limitation: The absence of the named identifier may cause TypeScript to incorrectly elide the import if no reference exists in the code.

TITLE: Handling Identifier Collisions in Angular Inputs - TypeScript
DESCRIPTION: Illustrates how Angular's input utility interacts with local and parent scope collisions, variable shadowing, and variable naming corner cases. The snippet explores scenarios where component properties shadow variables in other scopes, including nested functions. Depends on Angular's Component decorator and the custom input function. Key functions demonstrate input accesses, type checks, and safe use when variable collisions occur.

TITLE: Using @defer with 'hydrate never' to Prevent Initial Hydration (Angular HTML)
DESCRIPTION: This Angular HTML template snippet illustrates the `@defer` block with the `hydrate never` trigger combined with a regular `on viewport` trigger. `hydrate never` prevents the initial hydration of the `<large-cmp />` and its entire subtree after server-side rendering, treating it as static content initially. However, the regular `on viewport` trigger still applies for subsequent client-side rendering or navigation, loading the component when it enters the viewport in those scenarios.

An abstract class `LibHeaderToken` serves as the token. `LibHeaderComponent` extends this token and provides itself using `{provide: LibHeaderToken, useExisting: LibHeaderComponent}`. `LibCardComponent` now uses `@ContentChild(LibHeaderToken)` to query for the child, breaking the direct reference to `LibHeaderComponent` and enabling tree-shaking.
SOURCE: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/adev/src/content/guide/di/lightweight-injection-tokens.md#2025-04-22_snippet_4

LANGUAGE: typescript
CODE:
```
abstract class LibHeaderToken {}

@Component({
  selector: 'lib-header',
  providers: [
    {provide: LibHeaderToken, useExisting: LibHeaderComponent}
  ]
  …,
})
class LibHeaderComponent extends LibHeaderToken {}

@Component({
  selector: 'lib-card',
  …,
})
class LibCardComponent {
  @ContentChild(LibHeaderToken) header: LibHeaderToken|null = null;
}
```

TITLE: Binding Events Declaratively with JSAction Attribute (HTML)
DESCRIPTION: Demonstrates the recommended declarative way to register a click handler using the jsaction attribute. This allows the JSAction library to map an event type (click) to a handler name (confirmPurchase) before the handler code is loaded, enabling event capture prior to full app hydration. There are no dependencies aside from JSAction script setup. The button receives a jsaction attribute that enables centralized event delegation.

TITLE: Demonstrating Traditional Inline Event Registration (HTML)
DESCRIPTION: This snippet illustrates the classic pattern of querying a DOM element by ID and registering a click event handler using addEventListener. It highlights the potential pitfall in server-side rendering scenarios: user interactions before full app hydration are ignored. Readers require basic HTML/JavaScript knowledge; dependencies include the existence of an element with id 'buy_btn'. The code assigns an inline event handler that invokes app.confirmPurchase() but only after the handler code has loaded.
SOURCE: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/packages/core/primitives/event-dispatch/README.md#2025-04-22_snippet_0

LANGUAGE: html
CODE:
```
<body>\n  <button id=\"buy_btn\" type=\"button\">Buy now!</button>\n  ...\n  <!--\n  There's a window of time between when the button is rendered and the\n  script below reaches the client, either because there's a lot of content\n  streamed in-between, network lag, or the script is asynchronously loaded\n  via a follow-up network request rather than as part of the main document\n  content.\n  ->\n  ...\n  <script>\n    const btn = document.querySelector('#buy_btn');\n    // Until this line is executed, clicking on the button doesn't do\n    // anything. This can be a frustrating user experience.\n    btn.addEventListener('click', () => app.confirmPurchase());\n  </script>\n

}

var parentProto = new ProtoInjector([
  new BindingWithVisibility(Engine, Visibility.PublicAndPrivate),
  new BindingWithVisibility(Car, Visibility.Public)
]);
var parent = new Injector(parentProto);

var hostChildProto = new ProtoInjector([new BindingWithVisibility(Car, Visibility.Public)]);
var hostChild = new Injector(hostChildProto, parent, true);

var regularChildProto = new ProtoInjector([new BindingWithVisibility(Car, Visibility.Public)]);
var regularChild = new Injector(regularChildProto, parent, false);

hostChild.get(Car); // this works
parent.get(Car); // this works
regularChild.get(Car); // this works
```

This example shows that a host child injector *can* resolve a dependency (`Car`) requiring `Engine` via `@Host` when `Engine` is private to the parent, but the parent and regular child injectors cannot resolve `Car` because the required `Engine` is private.
SOURCE: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/packages/docs/di/di_advanced.md#2025-04-22_snippet_7

LANGUAGE: javascript
CODE:
```

}

var parentProto = new ProtoInjector([
  new BindingWithVisibility(Engine, Visibility.Private),
  new BindingWithVisibility(Car, Visibility.Public)
]);
var parent = new Injector(parentProto);

var hostChildProto = new ProtoInjector([new BindingWithVisibility(Car, Visibility.Public)]);
var hostChild = new Injector(hostChildProto, parent, true);

TITLE: Declaring the Angular Injector as Injectable via Special Token in TypeScript
DESCRIPTION: This TypeScript snippet demonstrates how the `Injector` class itself might be made injectable within Angular's dependency injection system in a tree-shakable way. It uses the `@Injectable` decorator with a special, internal `provideIn` token (`'__node_injector__'`) instead of a standard factory. This allows the `inject` function (shown in another snippet) to recognize requests for the `Injector` without coupling the generic DI system to renderer specifics.

TITLE: Type-Only Default Import with Angular Injectable - TypeScript
DESCRIPTION: This snippet demonstrates importing a class as a default import and using it in the type position for a constructor parameter within an Angular service marked with the @Injectable() decorator. The example illustrates how the imported identifier is used solely for typing but will later be required for value references during Angular's factory generation, which necessitates careful import preservation. Dependencies include Angular and TypeScript; the parameters include a default import (Foo) and an injectable service (Svc). Inputs: none; Output: Angular service class. Limitation: TypeScript may erroneously elide the import if not detected as a value usage.

TITLE: Pre-Written Instruction for Updating Commit Headers in Angular
DESCRIPTION: This snippet contains instructions for updating the commit header to align with Angular's requirements, using `git commit --amend` and force pushing with `git push` for corrections.
SOURCE: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/contributing-docs/saved-issue-replies.md#2025-04-22_snippet_9

LANGUAGE: plaintext
CODE:
```
It looks like you need to update your commit header to match our requirements. This is different from the PR title. To update the commit header, use the command `git commit --amend` and update the header there.

Once you've finished that update, you will need to force push using `git push [origin name] [branch name] --force`. That should address this.

TITLE: Injecting Special Angular Objects like ElementRef via Static Factory Property in TypeScript
DESCRIPTION: This TypeScript code illustrates how special Angular objects like `ElementRef` could be handled by the dependency injection system for tree-shaking purposes. By defining a static `__NG_ELEMENT_ID__` property that holds a factory function (`injectElementRef`), the `inject` mechanism can directly create an instance without searching the node tree or requiring explicit provider declaration in the `EXPANDO` section.

----------------------------------------

TITLE: Type-Only Named Import with Angular Class - TypeScript
DESCRIPTION: This snippet demonstrates importing a named export from another TypeScript file and referencing it in the type position within a class constructor. While initially used only as a type, Angular’s compilation may transform type usage into a runtime value usage (e.g., for dependency injection). Required dependencies: TypeScript; parameter: named import (Foo). Expected input: none; Output: class declaration with type-only usage. Limitation: if transformed for value usage, import needs to be preserved as a value import.

TITLE: Conceptual Rendering Logic for Angular i18n Messages (TypeScript)
DESCRIPTION: This pseudo-code demonstrates the core process of rendering an i18n string. It iterates through parts of the pre-processed i18n message; literal strings are accumulated directly, while numeric indices trigger lookups of bound values from `lViewData`. The accumulated parts are joined, potentially sanitized, and returned as the final string.
SOURCE: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/packages/core/src/render3/i18n/i18n.md#2025-04-22_snippet_3

LANGUAGE: typescript
CODE:

 /**
   * Collect intermediate interpolation values.
   */
  function accumulate(value: string|number): void {
    if (typeof value == 'number') {
      // if the value is a number then look it up in previous `i18nBind` location.
      value = lviewData[bindIndex + value];
    }
    accumulator.push(stringify(value));
  }

  /**
   * Flush final interpolation value.
   */
  function accumulatorFlush(sanitizer: null|((text: string)=>string) = null): string {
    let interpolation = accumulator.join('');
    if (sanitizer != null) {
      interpolation = sanitizer(interpolation);
    }
    accumulator.length = 0;

TITLE: Structure of I18nUpdateOpCodes for Attribute Updates (TypeScript)
DESCRIPTION: Details the internal `I18nUpdateOpCodes` array generated by the `i18nAttributes` instruction, stored in `TView.data`. This structure defines the operations for updating i18n attributes, including a change mask, instruction skip count, literal string parts, binding indices (represented by negative numbers like -1 referencing `lView[bindIndex - 1]`), and the target attribute update operation (element index, attribute name, sanitizer).
SOURCE: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/packages/core/src/render3/i18n/i18n.md#2025-04-22_snippet_6

LANGUAGE: typescript
CODE:
```
const i18nUpdateOpCodes = <I18nUpdateOpCodes>[
  // The following OpCodes represent: `<div i18n-title title="Hello �0�!">`
  // If `changeMask & 0b1`
  //        has changed then execute update OpCodes.
  //        has NOT changed then skip `7` values and start processing next OpCodes.
  0b1, 7,
  // Concatenate `newValue = 'Hello ' + lView[bindIndex-1] + '!';`.
  'Hello ',   // accumulate('Hello ');
  -1,         // accumulate(-1);
  '!',        // accumulate('!');
  // Update attribute: `elementAttribute(0, 'title', accumulatorFlush(null));`
  // NOTE: `null` means don't sanitize
  0 << SHIFT_REF | Attr, 'title', null,
]

----------------------------------------

TITLE: Defining Complex Angular Component Metadata with Variables and Functions in JavaScript
DESCRIPTION: This example shows a more complex Angular component definition where `selector` and `templateUrl` are derived from constants (`FOO_SELECTOR`, `TEMPLATE_BASE`) and a helper function (`getTemplateUrl`). This highlights the need for the Angular compiler (`ngtsc`) to statically evaluate expressions and follow references to determine the final metadata values during compilation. It depends on the `TEMPLATE_BASE` constant and `getTemplateUrl` function defined previously.
SOURCE: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/packages/compiler/design/architecture.md#2025-04-22_snippet_6

LANGUAGE: javascript
CODE:
```
```javascript
export const TEMPLATE_BASE = 'templates/';

export function getTemplateUrl(cmp: string): string {
  return TEMPLATE_BASE + cmp + '.html';
}

export const FOO_SELECTOR = 'foo-cmp';
export const FOO_TEMPLATE_URL = getTemplateUrl('foo');

@Component({
  selector: FOO_SELECTOR,
  templateUrl: FOO_TEMPLATE_URL,

TITLE: Demonstrating Asynchronous Message Handling in Angular DevTools
DESCRIPTION: This snippet outlines the potential issue with asynchronous message handling in Angular DevTools, showing how responses from earlier requests might override more recent state updates if not properly prioritized.
SOURCE: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/devtools/projects/protocol/README.md#2025-04-22_snippet_0

LANGUAGE: markdown
CODE:
```
1. We request the state of the component tree
1. We update the state
1. We request the state of the properties of a particular component

We don't have guarantees that the response of 1. will arrive before the response of 3. Often the response of 1. is larger and might be delivered after 3. In such a case, it may contain the application state prior to the update and override the state update we received from 3.

TITLE: Reading from Node Injector Using Enum-Based QueryReadType (TypeScript)
DESCRIPTION: Implements a function 'readFromNodeInjector' that inspects the 'read' parameter to determine what kind of reference to return among ElementRef, ViewContainerRef, and TemplateRef. Because the function checks 'read' against 'QueryReadType' enums, all referenced features are retained in the bundle irrespective of actual usage. This approach limits tree-shaking. Dependencies include 'LInjector', 'LNode', 'QueryReadType', and related factory functions.

TITLE: Manually Defining Angular Module Injector and Scope Statics - TypeScript
DESCRIPTION: Shows a manual approach to defining static properties (ɵinj and ngModuleScope) on the Angular module class, replicating what the Ivy compiler would generate mechanically. Requires angular core utilities and all referenced classes. The ɵinj static is initialized via ɵɵdefineInjector, configuring providers and imports, while ngModuleScope lists all declarations, selectors, and module references for the module. Inputs: assigned types and selectors. Output: custom class with Angular-compatible static metadata. Limitations: not all static fields are meaningful pre-compile, and symbolic errors from ɵɵdefineInjector may be ignored at runtime during Ivy compilation.
SOURCE: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/packages/compiler/design/separate_compilation.md#2025-04-22_snippet_7

LANGUAGE: TypeScript
CODE:

TITLE: Fixing Function Declaration in Block Scope in Zone.js
DESCRIPTION: Fixes an issue where function declarations were made in block scope, which is not allowed in strict mode. This resolves issues #53 and #54.
SOURCE: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/packages/zone.js/CHANGELOG.md#2025-04-22_snippet_18

LANGUAGE: JavaScript
CODE:
```
// Original problematic code:
function() {
  if (condition) {
    function foo() {}
  }
}

// Fixed code:
function() {
  var foo;
  if (condition) {
    foo = function() {};
  }
}
```

TITLE: Representing Directive Input Bindings in a TCB (TypeScript)
DESCRIPTION: Shows the Type Check Block (TCB) representation for a directive/component input binding. A variable (`_t1`) is declared with the directive's type (`OtherCmp`), and the input binding `[foo]="bar"` is translated into a TypeScript assignment `_t1.foo = this.bar`. This allows TypeScript to check if the type of `this.bar` is assignable to the input property `foo`.
SOURCE: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/packages/compiler-cli/src/ngtsc/typecheck/README.md#2025-04-22_snippet_5

LANGUAGE: typescript
CODE:
```
function tcb(this: SomeCmp): void {
  var _t1: OtherCmp = null!;
  _t1.foo = this.bar;
}

TITLE: Pseudo-Code for Angular's Internal `inject` Function Implementation in TypeScript
DESCRIPTION: This TypeScript pseudo-code outlines the logic of Angular's internal `inject` function, tying together concepts from the document. It shows how the function checks the provided token, specifically looking for the `Injector` token identified by the special `provideIn: '__node_injector__'` property (as defined in another snippet) to return a node-bound injector instance. For other tokens, it delegates the lookup to the `lookupTokenInExpando` function, which searches the internal `EXPANDO` data structures based on the rules described.
SOURCE: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/packages/core/src/render3/VIEW_DATA.md#2025-04-22_snippet_7

LANGUAGE: typescript
CODE:
```
```typescript
function inject(token: any): any {
  let injectableDef;
  if (typeof token === 'function' && injectableDef = token.ɵprov) {
    const provideIn = injectableDef.provideIn;
   if (provideIn === '__node_injector__') {
      // if we are injecting `Injector` than create a wrapper object around the inject but which
      // is bound to the current node.
      return createInjector();
    }
  }
  return lookupTokenInExpando(token);
}

TITLE: Configuring Language Redirection with Nginx
DESCRIPTION: This Nginx configuration example demonstrates how to serve a multi-locale Angular application. It sets up a map based on the `Accept-Language` HTTP header to determine the user's preferred language ('en' or 'fr'), defaulting to 'en'. It then uses this mapped language to rewrite the request URL to the corresponding language subdirectory (e.g., `/fr/`) if the header is present and the language is supported. A server block listens on port 80, defines the root directory, and includes standard file serving configurations along with the language-based rewrite rule.

TITLE: Type-Only Default Import Statement - TypeScript
DESCRIPTION: This concise snippet defines a module default import. When used only in type positions, such as in type annotations, TypeScript may later remove this import if it believes it is unused at runtime, which can cause runtime errors if value references are later generated (e.g., by Angular’s decorators). Dependency: TypeScript. Expected input: named module; Output: default import binding symbol. Limitation: requires vigilant import preservation logic if value usage is injected during transformation.
SOURCE: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/packages/compiler-cli/src/ngtsc/imports/README.md#2025-04-22_snippet_3

# Hydration benchmark

This folder contains hydration benchmark that tests the process of matching DOM nodes at runtime.

There are 2 folders in this benchmark:

* `baseline` - renders a component without hydration, we use it as a baseline
* `main` - the same code as the `baseline`, but Angular uses hydration and matches existing DOM nodes instead of creating new ones

The benchmarks are based on `largetable` benchmarks.

LANGUAGE: html
CODE:
```
<docs-card-container>
  <docs-card title="Signal Forms" href="">
  We plan to analyze existing feedback about Angular forms and design a solution which addresses developers' requirements and uses Signals for management of reactive state.
  </docs-card>
  <docs-card title="Selectorless" href="">
  To reduce boilerplate and improve the ergonomics of standalone components we are now designing a solution that will make selectors optional. To use a component or directive you'll be able to import it and directly use it in a component's template.

  We're still in early stages of planning selectorless. We'll share a request for comments when we have an early design and we're ready for next steps.
  </docs-card>
  <docs-card title="Exploration of streamed server-side rendering" href="">
  Over the past few releases we've been working on making Angular's server-side rendering story more robust. On our priority list is to explore streamed server-side rendering for zoneless application.
  </docs-card>
  <docs-card title="Investigation for authoring format improvements" href="">
  Based on our developer surveys' results we saw there are opportunities for improving the ergonomics of the component authoring format. The first step of the process will be to gather requirements and understand the problem space in advanced to an RFC. We'll share updates as we make progress. High priority in the future work will be backward compatibility and interoperability.
  </docs-card>
  <docs-card title="Improve TestBed" href="">
  Based on feedback over the years and the recent updates in Angular's runtime, we'll evaluate TestBed to identify opportunities to improve developer experience and reduce boilerplate when developing unit tests.
  </docs-card>
  <docs-card title="Incremental adoption" href="">
  Angular has been lacking the tools and the flexibility to add interactivity to a multi-page app or embed an Angular component inside of an existing app built with a different framework.

  As part of this project, we'll explore the requirement space of cross framework interop and our build tooling offering to make this use case possible.

<docs-workflow>

<docs-step title="Adapt the logo colors as your own">
Lean into the shape of Angular's new logo by changing the logo colors to match your brand colors, flag, cause, etc.

In this example, we've adapted the colors to create an Angular Pride logo variation:
![Angular pride logo](assets/images/press-kit/angular_pride.png#small "Angular pride logo")
</docs-step>

<docs-step title="Adapt the logo shape as your own">
Lean into the shape of Angular's new logo by adapting the shield to match your own brand.

In this example, we've adapted the shield to create an Angular Signals logo variation:
![Angular Signals logo](assets/images/press-kit/angular_signals.png#medium "Angular Signals logo")
</docs-step>

<docs-step title="Do's and don'ts of using Angular's brand">
If you are creating your own logo, we encourage differentiating your logo from ours to not cause confusion. When adapting the logo, you are free to change and adapt the colors and shape to make it your own.
  
When representing Angular with the original logo, please follow these guidelines:
![Rhubarb the small cat](assets/images/press-kit/do_and_dont.png "Rhubarb the small cat")
</docs-step>

TITLE: Describing Child Query Result Error in Angular
DESCRIPTION: This markdown snippet explains the error that occurs when a required child query result is accessed before it's available or when a query has no matches. It details the timing of content and view query result calculations and provides guidance on when these results become accessible.
SOURCE: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/adev/src/content/reference/errors/NG0951.md#2025-04-22_snippet_0

LANGUAGE: markdown
CODE:
```
# Child query result is required but no value is available.

Required child query (`contentChild.required` or `viewChild.required`) result was accessed before query results were calculated or query has no matches.

This can happen in two distinct situations:
* query results were accessed before a given query could collect results;
* a query was executed but didn't match any nodes and has no results as a consequence.

Content queries and view queries each calculate their results at different points in time:
* `contentChild` results are available after a _host_ view (template where a directive declaring a query is used) is created;
* `viewChild` results are available after a template of a component declaring a query is created.

Accessing query results before they're available results in the error described on this page. Most notably, query results are _never_ available in a constructor of the component or directive declaring a query.

## Fixing the error

`contentChild` query results can be accessed in the `AfterContentChecked` lifecycle hook, or later.
`viewChild` query results can be accessed in the `AfterViewChecked` lifecycle hook, or later.

Make sure that a required query matches at least one node and has results at all. You can verify this by accessing query results in the lifecycle hooks listed above.
